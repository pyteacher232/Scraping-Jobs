Deliverables are 2 Python Scripts:

1. I am looking for a Python Script that will allow me to scrape the website https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search (all 1939 pages worth -- without it breaking)
to extract Sponsor Name and Starting Data into a CSV file

2. I am also looking for a Python script to extract data from a supplied XML document into CSV. The DOM for the XML is as follows:

I am interested in getting all tag names of "nct_id" + "start_date" + "lead_sponsor" + "collaborator" in CSV per row

Not that for one NCT ID there may be more than 1 collaborator. I would like these listed as additional rows with the same NCT ID, start date, etc.
